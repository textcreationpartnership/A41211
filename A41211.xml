            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing both provoked and invited to make ſome Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>'s Book of <hi>Scriptures Miſtaken,</hi> I aſſayed to do it as briefly as I could; and it was needful I ſhould confine my ſelf to the Order, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and to the places of Scripture, he examined as urged by Proteſtants againſt the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and to thoſe he alledges as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſsing for it.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing he boaſts in his <hi>Preface,</hi> that he will deal with the Proteſtants, and beat them at their own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, <hi>Scripture:</hi> and ſo comes not to the trial of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, and with too much confidence preſumes to be their own: therefore
<pb facs="tcp:95326:3"/>I ſhall add <hi>A Brief Survey</hi> of the Ancient Doctrine and Practiſe of the Catholick Church, as to the points here Controverted; that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, how they are worſted there, what brags ſoever they make of Antiquity.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, There are Bocks enough and too many: which do but continue the Controverſie, and keep the breach open; More need there is to endeavour ſome cloſing, and to make offers of Agreement. True, if we could conceive any hope of condeſcention on their parts, or perceive any intent of Peace in them, whom we ſtill finde ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the catch, and laying hold upon all advantages, which may promote their cauſe with all ſorts of people: into whoſe hands they thruſt ſuch Books, as may render it more plauſible, and into whoſe ears they are continually whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what may repreſent the Proteſtant as guilty of Schiſm, and Hereſie: thereby enforcing us to break ſilence, and to inform our People (if we will not have them ſeduced) of the cunning of our Adverſaries, to diſcover their
<pb facs="tcp:95326:3"/>Dawbings, and vain Pretences, ſuch as Mr. <hi>Spencer</hi> and others ſent over to the ſame purpoſe, do uſe for deceiving of the Unwary.</p>
            <p>Peace among Chriſtians, ſurely is the moſt beſeeming, the moſt deſirable Thing in the world; and would be, conſidering how it now ſtands with the too much divided Catholick Church, the greateſt bleſsing; and we have been ſufficiently taught how to value it by the paſt and preſent diſtractions and differences amongſt us. But when we talk of Peace to them of <hi>Rome,</hi> they are ready to reproach us with <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian heal thy ſelf,</hi> make up your own breaches and Diviſions, before you ſpeak of being received into the Unity of the Catholick Church. Let them alone a while with their ſo much pretended unity: our firſt care certainly is to make peace at home, and in the mean time (as we ſee it the care and prudence of all States to guard the Borders againſt the Forrein and Common Enemy) to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thoſe Doctrines wherein the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties diſſenting do agree, and are
<pb facs="tcp:95326:4"/>as within common bounds encloſed.</p>
            <p>And bleſſed be God, we have a great expedient for the reſtoring of our Peace by the return of our gracious Soveraign unto us; who is the true <hi>Defender</hi> of the Faith, the great <hi>Example</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in Religion, and of Clemency in fogiving and forgetting injuries. And when we his Subjects, being aſſured of the Truth and Religion which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, have alſo learned to obey by <hi>His Example,</hi> and with mutual condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and endeavours of peace, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and embrace one another: then ſhall our hearts be better prepared with a charitable compliance for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary abroad, when ſoever he ſhall think it convenient to admit thoughts of Peace, and ſhall ſeriouſly conſider how we are all bound to profeſs and believe <hi>One</hi> (not <hi>Roman,</hi> but <hi>Chriſtian) Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We cannot but be ſenſible, what hand they that ſtile themſelves <hi>Catholicks,</hi> have had in kindling this fire among us, and bringing fuel to it: and we would have them (being ſo oft convinced and
<pb facs="tcp:95326:4"/>told of it) ſenſible, how unchriſtian, uncatholick a part it is; how contrary to the Peace of the Church.</p>
            <p>But could they that are ſent over amongſt us to blow the coals, forget their Inſtructions, and Vow of Obedience: and they that ſend them learn to value the Peace of Chriſtendome: yet what hope (may ſome ask) could there be of an Accord in <hi>Doctrine?</hi> If we conſider what paſſed in the Germain Colloquies, during the Time of the <hi>Trent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> and obſerve what condeſcention and moderation appeared then, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the intervention of ſo many <hi>Nuncio's</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ſo much boaſted pretence of Infallibility in that Church: If alſo we carefully look into their Controverſie-Writers, and note what conceſsions they ſometimes make in the point, what mincings of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> doctrine, when they are put to it: there may appear a poſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the thing it ſelf, if peaceable men had the handling of it. But when we conſider on the other hand, how all thoſe endeavours for Peace became Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs:
<pb facs="tcp:95326:5"/>and all the offers made at Truth by moderate Men in that Council were ſilenced and rejected; and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all their mincings and conceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in thoſe points, the Doctrine and Practiſe of that Church goes as high as ever: We may imagine there are ſome <hi>over-ruling points</hi> of State-doctrine, (of the <hi>Court</hi> rather then <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>) which command the Reſt and forbid all condeſcention and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſuch at leaſt, as may give us any hope of a tolerable agreement.</p>
            <p>And thus it will be, what ever we endeavour, till order be taken with him, that pretends to the Infallibility and exorbitant Power: of whom we may ſay in this particular, as the Apoſtle doth of that lawleſs perſon, <hi>2 Theſſ. 2.7. He who now letteth, will let, until he be taken out of the way:</hi> that is, until he be reduced within the bounds of the Canons of the Catholick Church. A glorious work for Chriſtian Princes: a work of greateſt concernment to the Peace of Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>But till that be done, I would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb facs="tcp:95326:5"/>thoſe conſiderations following, to All, that delight, or are inclined to be in the Communion of that Church, and in ſubjection to that pretended infallible and all-powerful Head.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> Why ſhould they deſire to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a lawleſs boundleſs Power? under a Head ſo notoriouſly perjured? If this ſeem harſh; let them ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what they in reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience finde to excuſe him from that charge, who bindes himſelf by Oath in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> and then in the Papal <hi>Chair</hi> holds himſelf looſe from what he ſware to obſerve; who alſo ſwears to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Canons of the Ancient Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, yet will not keep within the bounds, they have ſet Him; but challenges and exerciſes an Univerſal Juriſdiction, to the overthrow of that Government, which thoſe Canons have fixed in the Way of the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> Why they ſhould ſo much deſire to be of the Communion of that Church, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> (while the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſuffered
<pb facs="tcp:95326:6"/>to deſine all, to over-rule all) is in ſo dangerous a condition. This will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if they conſider:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that through the pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of their Head, they can have no certain ground-work or Reaſon of their belief; but are in a way to loſe all true Faith. For let the <hi>Cardinal</hi> make the <hi>Propoſition:</hi> If the Pope could Erre or turn Heretick, then would the Church be bound to this Abſurdity or inconveniency of taking Vice for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Error for Truth. (This he plainly laies down in his <hi>4.</hi> Book <hi>de Pontifice,</hi> and its good Doctrine in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain.)</hi> Then let the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church and more Moderate Papiſts make the <hi>Aſſumption: But the Pope may turn Heretick;</hi> what can the <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> ſpeak, but the hazard of that Church, which will be under ſuch a pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Head?</p>
            <p>Secondly, That by being of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion they are taught to appropriate to themſelves the Name of <hi>Catholick:</hi> and thereby bound to an uncharitable condemning of all other Chriſtians, and
<pb facs="tcp:95326:6"/>to a neceſsity of proving many Novel Errors, to be ancient Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. We do not envie them, the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> that they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it together withall other Chrictians, who are baptized into the Catholick Faith, and do profeſs it without any deſtructive Hereſie; but the appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that Title to themſelves, (and that in regard of thoſe ſpecial ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Articles of Faith, proper to that Church) implies all other Chriſtians to be no better then Hereticks, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all conditions of Peace, unleſs they will come in, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to <hi>Naaſh,</hi> with their <hi>right eyes put out, 1 Sam. 10.</hi> Whereas upon due trial we may confidently affirm, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that no Church of known and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient denomination, as <hi>Greek, Aſian, African, Britiſh,</hi> doth leſs deſerve to be called Catholick, or has more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited that Name: becauſe none ſo much falſified her truſt; whether we conſider the Errors entertained, or the Impoſing them as Catholick, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:95326:7"/>
            <p>The three great concernments of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſo of the Church are, the <hi>Faith</hi> profeſſed, the <hi>Worſhip</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the <hi>Sacraments</hi> adminiſtred: all which are dangerouſly violated in that Church. For firſt, How have they kept the <hi>Faith undefiled,</hi> (which the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſian</hi> Creed ſo ſeverely enjoyns) that have mixed it with ſuch New ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Articles, and lay the foundation of their belief upon the uncertain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of a pretended Infallibility?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Worſhip of God is there violated by the performing it in an unknown tongue; for without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the people cannot ſay <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> The prayer on their parts is but a <hi>ſacrifice of fools,</hi> not a <hi>reaſonable ſervice.</hi> Again, Violated in yielding to the Creature an undue <hi>religious ſervice;</hi> as may appear by what is ſaid in the three firſt Chapters of this Book.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Sacraments</hi> violated, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of New ones, and thoſe properly ſo called. A great invaſion it is upon Gods property, if any man or Church
<pb facs="tcp:95326:7"/>hold out that for the Sacramental Sign and Inſtrument of Grace, which God who is the only Author of Grace, has not appointed to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Again, upon that which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did undoubtedly inſtitute, a great invaſion is made, by firſt taking away the ſubſtance from the outward Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then taking away from the people half of that, which remains. Our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> Mat. <hi>26.27.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith <hi>Ye ſhall not all Drink of it:</hi> Nay, None of you ſhall, but the Prieſt only.</p>
            <p>Add to this, the Impoſsibility they put themſelves upon (as I ſaid) to prove all their New Articles of belief (for which they will be the only Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks) to be the Ancient Faith, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctrine of the Church. They will hardly be brought to ſay, The Church may make New Articles of Faith: but rather, The Church may declare, what was before but implicitly believed. This is true if duly explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: yet will it not excuſe the boldneſs
<pb facs="tcp:95326:8"/>of that Church. For when the Church declares any thing as of Faith, which was not expreſly taught before, it is ſuch a Truth, as was neceſſarily conteined and couched in the confeſſed Articles of the Creed, and by immediate conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence clearly thence deduceable; as the <hi>Conſubſtantiality of the Son,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt the <hi>Arrians:</hi> the <hi>two Wills</hi> in Chriſt, againſt the <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelites:</hi> the continuance of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in its own nature and ſubſtance, againſt the <hi>Eutychians:</hi> This is that which <hi>Vincentius</hi> ſaith in his <hi>32.</hi> chap. <hi>What elſe did the Church endeavour in the Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, but that, what before was ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply believed, might afterward be more diligently and explicitly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi>— And to ſhew that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith do not increaſe in <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> but in the <hi>dilatation</hi> of more ample knowledge, He aptly uſes the ſimilitude of the ſeveral parts of the Natural body, which are as many in a childe as in a grown man; no addition made of new parts; for that
<pb facs="tcp:95326:8"/>would render the body monſtrous; but each part is dilated and augmented by degrees. To this purpoſe he, in his <hi>29.</hi> chap. When therefore the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> can ſhew their Novel Articles by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and neceſſary conſequence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceable from the confeſſed Truthes of that Creed, into which we are baptized: then and not till then can we excuſe this boldneſs in adding to the Chriſtian Faith, &amp; this uncharitable Pride in boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting themſelves the only <hi>Catholicks.</hi>

            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> May they conſider, how their Maſters being engaged in ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of making good the pretended Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctrine of that Church, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten forced to wink at the light and go on blindfold.</p>
            <p>Their Maſters acknowledg, and ſo does their <hi>Trent</hi> Council, that the <hi>worſhip</hi> of Saints and Angels, <hi>Invocation</hi> of them, <hi>Adoration</hi> of Images, is not <hi>commanded,</hi> but <hi>commended</hi> as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. Why then ſhould Scripture be ſo oft alledged to deceive the unwary? why are they retained as profitable, when
<pb facs="tcp:95326:9"/>Experience ſhews what a <hi>ſcandal</hi> is thereby given to Jews and Turks? what <hi>offence</hi> to ſo many Chriſtians as proteſt againſt them? what a <hi>ſtumbling block</hi> to their own people, expoſed thereby to the danger of Idolatry?</p>
            <p>They acknowlege, that our Saviour inſtituted the Sacrament and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred it in both kindes; and that it was ſo from the beginning received and practiſed in the whole Church, yet will not the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuffer the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo to receive it. And in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this half Communion, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, if the Church alter any thing in or about the Sacraments, yet it muſt be <hi>Salvâ illorum ſubſtantia,</hi> ſaving their ſubſtance, <hi>Concil. Trid. ſeſ. 21. c. 2.</hi> which notwithſtanding, they can take away the whole ſubſtance of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and defraud the people of the half of what is left: and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our Saviours Inſtitution, and the Cuſtom of the whole Church for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages: <hi>This cuſtom muſt be held for a Law, which none may contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> as that Council decrees in the ſame chap.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:95326:9"/>
            <p>They acknowledge, it is fit the people communicate with the Prieſt in every Maſs, <hi>i.e.</hi> they acknowledge it is fit there ſhould be no <hi>private Maſſes,</hi> and they <hi>wiſh</hi> it were ſo, and yet decree the contrary, <hi>cap. 6. de Miſſa.</hi> So they acknowledge the Maſs conteins <hi>(magnam populi eruditionem)</hi> great edification and inſtruction for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet decree it <hi>not expedient to have it</hi> (or the Liturgy) <hi>in the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or vulgar tongue, cap. 8.</hi> But if the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſeen it equally to their advantage, they could have held the people to that which they ought, <hi>viz.</hi> the Communion, as well as keep all their Prieſts from that, which they ought not, <hi>viz.</hi> Marriage.</p>
            <p>They acknowledge that Juſtification precedes good Works. <hi>Soſ. 6. c. 8.</hi> yet deliver this doctrine <hi>(Juſtified by Works)</hi> groſly to the People; They know, how it is to their advantage. And in the <hi>16.</hi> chap. of that Seſsion, They acknowledge the grace of God for performance of the work, and his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſe of the reward: yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
<pb facs="tcp:95326:10"/>that good Works do <hi>truly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Add to this, their mincing of points of doctrine, when they are put to it. As when the enquiry is driven home, what worſhip is due to Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. What Invocation to be uſed. VVhat worſhip or adoration to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Images. We ſee how they leſſen it, and ſeem to be contented with very little, as we obſerve in Mr. <hi>Spencers</hi> conceſsions upon thoſe points: yet do they keep up the practiſe, in the height and full extent, ſuffering (if not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging) the people to perform it groſly and ſuperſtitiouſly: as they muſt needs do, being uncapable of ſuch nice diſtinctions, as are uſed to excuſe that worſhip.</p>
            <p>So when they are put to it in the points of <hi>Satisfactions, Purgatory, Indulgences,</hi> to ſhew what is ſatisfied for, what is remitted, and conſequently what is granted in the Indulgence, and to what ſort of Perſons; they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to bring it to ſuch an uncertainty, and to ſo ſmall a ſcantling, that the
<pb facs="tcp:95326:10"/>people, if they knew it, would conſider well what they laid out that way, before they parted with it; but theſe points are ſo in groſs propounded to the people, that they have cauſe to think (as generally they do) they are by theſe ſatisfactions and indulgences freed from any ſin, and do eſcape thereby Hell fire it ſelf.</p>
            <p>This which has been ſaid, ſpeaks conceſsions and yieldings on their part, and ſhewes a poſsibility of agreement, and that ſome fair way might be found for ſome tolerable accord: did not fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy lucre, gotten by thoſe points, and the exorbitant greatneſs of Papal power ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct it: the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> (as we ſee in all the offers made for reformation) being alwaies more ſollicitous of uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſelf, then of reforming the <hi>Church:</hi> of advancing its own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then of promoting the peace of Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>To conclude. The peace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the agreement of the <hi>Roman</hi> and other Churches is poſsible, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>e poſsible for the Pope to do his duty, or Chriſtian Princes, theirs: that is, if
<pb facs="tcp:95326:11"/>he would do the duty of a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or prime Patriarch, the duty he is bound to, ſworn to, in taking oath to obſerve the Canons of the Ancient General Councils, which preſcribe the bounds of the <hi>Roman,</hi> and other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal Juriſdictions. But if he make light of this and all other bonds of duty, why ſhould it not be poſsible for Chriſtian Princes to do their duty in reducing him within thoſe known and confeſſed bounds, fixed by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church?</p>
            <p>In the mean time, let them ceaſe to reproach us with <hi>Schiſm,</hi> till he return to his ſtation, where he may receive the obedience due to him by thoſe Ancient Canons: let them rather conſider, whom they follow, in all his tranſgreſſions and extravagances, thereby engaging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in his <hi>Schiſm</hi> againſt the whole Catholick Church. And let them not pleaſe themſelves with the ſpecious Name of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> for holding ſuch points of Difference from other Chriſtians, as will upon trial appear to be far from the Truth and ſoundneſs of Catholick
<pb facs="tcp:95326:11"/>Doctrine. And to make this appear by the undeniable Rules of Chriſtian ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Catholick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> (as they are ſolidly ſet down by <hi>Vincentius</hi>) is the ſcope and purpoſe of this enſuing Treatiſe.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95326:30"/>feign two reaſons of this prohibiting or refuſal of worſhip: firſt,

Secondly, <hi>becauſe</hi> John <hi>took the Angel for Chriſt:</hi> but we may ask, how did the Angel know what St. <hi>John</hi> thought? Beſides, it was improbable that he took the Angel for our Saviour Chriſt, for this is the ſecond time, that he thus worſhipped: neither do we find that our Saviour in all the viſions appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him after ſuch a manner. But this falling down at the Angels feet, <hi>ſhews</hi> it was in St. <hi>John</hi> a tranſport of joy, for the revelation of ſuch things as the Angel brought, and thereupon an expreſſion of that (more then beſeeming) reverence to the meſſenger: and it is evident the Angel conceived he gave ſome undue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, for which he admoniſhes him to give none, but what befits <hi>a fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> which ought not to be a religious
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95326:30"/>worſhip or ſervice entrenching upon any thing due to God: the very reaſon that

Should we therefore demand, what juſtification is this that S. <hi>James</hi> treats of, firſt or ſecond? he muſt confeſs his impertinency: for the Apoſtle here treats of the firſt, the true and proper Juſtification, and that both he and his <hi>Trent</hi> Council acknowledge moſt free, and not by works; now this Author acknowledges it is the ſame Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication which S. <hi>James</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> treats of, and its evident by S. <hi>James</hi> citing the ſame Scripture for his Juſtification v. 23. whic S. <hi>Paul</hi> does Rom. 4.3. <hi>Abraham believed and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs;</hi> But it is plain that S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:95326:61"/>every where treats of the firſt and proper Juſtification; The other example alſo that S. <hi>James</hi> makes uſe of, (<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Rahab</hi>) plainly ſpeaks the firſt Juſtification. And therefore this Author ſpending his whole diſcourſe againſt that diſtinction of being <hi>Juſtified before God and before men;</hi> to prove that S. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Juſtification before God, does but prove what we allow, and what makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, who muſt acknowledge a man is truly juſtified before God before he does ſuch works.</p>
               <p>Seeing then this is the firſt Juſtification which S. <hi>James</hi> intends, and that as both they and we ſay, is not by works: this cannot without groſs miſtake and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency be objected (as it is by them) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; but they and we are both of us concerned to reconcile the ſeeming contrariety between the two Apoſtles. As for the diſtinction of Juſtification <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,</hi> and <hi>before men</hi> (albeit there may be a ſeveral conſideration of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to that purpoſe, and good works do declare a man Juſtified, and (as I may ſay) do juſtify his faith, yet) we need not here make uſe of it; but the purpoſe of S. <hi>Iames</hi> in writing this Epiſtle does direct us rather to a ſeveral conſideration of Faith or believing: for when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95326:61"/>a man <hi>to be juſtified by faith alone:</hi> he ſpeaks not of a lively working faith, (to which S. <hi>Paul</hi> attributes juſtification) but of a bare and ſeeming faith, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion only, and (as to good works) dead and barren, ſuch as they reſted in againſt whom he writes. This is plain by S. <hi>James</hi> his ſubjoyning v. 23. <hi>and the Scripture was fulfilled which ſaith</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>believed</hi> &amp;c. how could the Apoſtle bring this Scripture (the ſame that S. <hi>Paul</hi> does for juſtifying faith <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3.) in confirmation of what he ſaith of works, but to ſhew, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith which juſtified him, was a working faith?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Now if the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves leſs concerned (for fear of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer truth) to labour in the clearing of the contrariety which ſeems to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Apoſtles;
<note place="margin">Romaniſts confound their Firſt and Second Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and think it more popular, and for their advantage, to cry up S. <hi>James</hi> his bare words of <hi>juſtification by works:</hi> we cannot help it; but muſt only note their wilfull miſtake and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, in ſo eagerly urging S. <hi>Iames,</hi> who ſpeaks of the firſt juſtification. Mr. <hi>Spencer</hi> indeed promiſes <hi>pa.</hi> 148. to reconcile the two Apoſtles: but does it ſo, as neither of them will be reconciled to his ſecond juſtification; as we ſhall ſee by examining the places of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:95326:62"/>which he inſiſts on, to ſhew the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants miſtaken: but firſt take notice of what he ſaith here upon occaſion of the former Text of S. <hi>Iames. Iuſtified by good works, working with faith, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting it, informing and vivificating it, as S.</hi> James <hi>deſcribes them here,</hi> p. 148. This is not only impertinent but guilty of falſhood, belying the Apoſtle; for firſt he ſaid not,

                     </gap> Ja. 2.22.</note> that <hi>works wrought with faith, but that his faith wrought with his works.</hi> Secondly, Albeit the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>by works was faith made perfect,</hi> yet does he not therefore <hi>deſcribe</hi> works as <hi>informing</hi> and <hi>vivificating it;</hi> for here is no other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection meant, then what the effect brings to the Agent, fruit to the tree, operation to the power or virtue from which it is; as every thing that is made for uſe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to practice and operation, is then ſaid to be made perfect and conſummate, when it comes to working; but this is far from <hi>informing</hi> or <hi>vivificating</hi> it; he may as well ſay <hi>the breath</hi> which proceeds from the life of the body (its S. <hi>Iames</hi> his ſimilitude v. 26.) does inform and viviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it; In like manner good works do not inform, or give life to faith, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from it: proceeding from it as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and fruits: the whole chapter <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. ſhews it, ſpeaking the effects of faith,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95326:62"/>even of <hi>Abrahams</hi> here mentioned. And that which this Author <hi>pa.</hi> 143. gathers from his <hi>Trent</hi> Council, ſpeaks plainly (as we noted above) that men <hi>are freely juſtified,</hi> and then do good works: And this ſhews <hi>his impertinency,</hi> for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire (fidem formatam) <hi>faith informed,</hi> for the firſt juſtification, how then by works that follow? and his inadvertency in again croſſing their own doctrine, for they ſay, <hi>Faith is informed by charity infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the firſt juſtification:</hi> how then by works that come after?</p>
               <p>Now for the Places out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which he inſiſts on to ſhew the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants miſtaken. The firſt is,
<q>
                     <bibl>Rom. 3.28.</bibl> 
                     <p>
                        <hi>Without the works of the Law.</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here, and in all ſuch places which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the <hi>works of the Law:</hi> he will have Proteſtants miſtaken in the undeſtanding of <hi>the works of the Law:</hi> Becauſe by the Law is underſtood, <hi>that which is written in the books of</hi> Moſes <hi>both Moral and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial,</hi> and by works of the Law, Saint <hi>Paul underſtands ſuch works as are done by force and knowledge of the Law, before the faith of Chriſt is infuſed into the ſoul, or that it is enlightned, and aſſiſted by his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95326:63"/>grace,</hi> pa. 149, &amp;c. It is true that <hi>the Law</hi> is often ſo taken: but when the Apoſtle excluds <hi>works of the Law</hi> in relation to <hi>Abrahams</hi> juſtification, it cannot refer to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law after given and written. But the ſpeech <hi>by faith and not by works,</hi> comes to this iſſue: no man can be juſtified by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or working according to the Law he is under: Not <hi>Abraham</hi> by the works of the Law then; Not Jews by the works, of the Law then, the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Not Chriſtians by works, or by doing what they are bound to do, by the Law and Commandements which they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; But by reaſon of their many failings in thoſe <hi>works</hi> and <hi>doings,</hi> they muſt ſtand <hi>by faith</hi> apprehending Chriſts obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſatisfaction, to bear them out againſt the ſentence of the Law, or Gods judgment.</p>
               <p>And it is true alſo, that the Apoſtle ſometimes takes the <hi>works of the Law</hi> for ſuch as are <hi>done by force and knowledge of the Law, before the faith of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. as when he ſpeaks of ſuch as ſought righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by the works of the Law without Chriſt; but we cannot think the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle excludes works of the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as are done before grace (as this Author ſaith) from juſtifying, to admit works done in grace into their ſtead for juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95326:63"/>nor think, that as Phariſees ſought it by the former works and miſt of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31. ſo the Romaniſts may ſeek it by the latter ſort of works, and finde it; for <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3, 4, 5, 6, 9. he ſets the righteouſneſs of the Law and of faith ſimply one againſt the other: neither can <hi>the righteouſneſs of faith</hi> be imagined to be <hi>any righteouſneſs of our working.</hi> Obſerve farther what this Author ſaith <hi>pa.</hi> 150. that <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 20. is added <hi>By the law is the knowledge of ſin,</hi> which is a reaſon wherefore ſuch works as are done by the knowledge of the Law only, cannot juſtify; from whence we likewiſe infer; If by the Law is the knowledge of ſin, and the Law ſtill convinces thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace, of ſin: they cannot be juſtified by their works before God: <hi>David</hi> and holy men in his time had the ſame way of juſtification as we (notwithſtanding they were under <hi>Moſes</hi> Law) who when they were juſtified and in grace, were concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to acknowledge. <hi>If God would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme to mark what is done amiſs, who could abide it, or ſtand?</hi> Pſal. 130. and to pray, <hi>Enter not into judgment with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtified:</hi> Pſal. 143.2. that is, if thou in ſtrict judgment wilt examine what he does. The latter part of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95326:64"/>verſe is ſometimes thus repeated by the Apoſtle, <hi>No fleſh can be juſtified,</hi> Rom. 3.20. Gal. 2. v. 16. which word <hi>fleſh</hi> Mr. <hi>Spencer,</hi> vainly takes hold on as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying one not yet ſpiritual but carnal, under the guilt of ſin and corruption of nature: So <hi>pa.</hi> 158. But <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks it in relation to himſelf: <hi>No man can be juſtified,</hi> not <hi>thy ſervant,</hi> by his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. So that ſtill upon the ſame reaſon, no man under the Goſpel can be juſtified in the ſight of God, by what he does: becauſe the Law convinces him of ſin, (and to the ſame purpoſe it is ſaid, <hi>We make God a Liar if we ſay we have not ſin,</hi> 1 <hi>Io.</hi> 1.10.) So that if God enter with him into judgment he cannot be juſtified, if the Lord mark what is done amiſs he cannot abide it.</p>
               <p>What he ſaith to <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. as to the works of the Law, is the ſame he ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove to <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. and needs no farther reply. But that which is the main ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and will eaſe us of farther trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this controverſie, is his limiting of the word <hi>Juſtify</hi> in thoſe and the other places of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles acknowledging they ſpeak every where of the firſt juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which is not by works. So then the <hi>Proteſtant poſition</hi> (as he calls it) of <hi>juſtification by faith only,</hi> ſtands good as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95326:64"/>they intend it: <hi>by faith only,</hi> i. e. <hi>not by works,</hi> and this alſo ſhews their excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the word <hi>only,</hi> is needleſs and therefore the <hi>miſtake</hi> he faſtens on us <hi>pa.</hi> 148. groundleſs; the word <hi>only</hi> being but excluſive to <hi>works,</hi> which he and his Council exclude from the firſt juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> Now for his Second Juſtification to which he retires from the force of all that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of juſtification:
<note place="margin">Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and increaſe of grace, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> it is not worth our contending about, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpeech, which controverſies require; for we acknowledge all that he or his Council ſpeaks of this ſecond juſtification, to be done in ſanctification, and to be properly ſo called, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>renovation</hi> and <hi>increaſe</hi> of that grace and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion received: and that ſuch <hi>increaſe</hi> is made by works or acting: Philoſophy teaches, it is ſo in ordinary habits, much more in theſe which have alſo the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit for their increaſe. But if he would have ſaid any thing to purpoſe, whereby this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi> of righteouſneſs by works, ſhould ſeem to deſerve to bear any ſenſe of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: he ſhould have reſolved us (as I noted above) whether a man in grace may by good works merit the remiſſion of his ſin into which he is fall'n, as <hi>David;</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:95326:65"/>and as he granted <hi>pa.</hi> 142. that <hi>the firſt juſtification could not be merited by works,</hi> ſo he ſhould have told us plainly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remiſſion and reſtauration of a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſon after his fall (which may be called in ſome ſort a <hi>ſecond juſtification)</hi> can by any works of that perſon be meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? They ſometimes pretend to this, when they urge <hi>Daniels</hi> ſaying to <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar, Redeem</hi> (break off) <hi>thy ſins by righteouſneſs</hi>— c. 4.27. Where let the Tranſlation go as they would have it by the word <hi>redeem:</hi> yet muſt they confeſs, this remiſſion of ſins to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> would have been the firſt juſtification, and not to be acquired by works; in like manner they muſt acknowledge their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency, when by <hi>Luc.</hi> 7.47. <hi>for ſhe loved much,</hi> they endeavour to prove, that her love was the cauſe of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, when this was her firſt juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But thus do they confound their firſt and ſecond juſtification, in their proofs of juſtification by works, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed by argument, they retire for anſwer to their ſecond Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>That which they cite out of <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. <hi>juſtificetur adhuc,</hi> let <hi>him be juſtified ſtill,</hi> is all the pretence they have for this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond juſtification: where we accord with

That part of the <hi>Trent</hi> decree which pretends to this juſtification by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of righteouſneſs,

                  <p>Secondly, Souldiers have not from the Emperour (that ſo rewards or gratifies them) the ſtrength, courage, and valour which he ſo rewards in them; but this Donative of Gods gift implies ſuch noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of grace (free grace, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ſervice, free grace for the acceptation of the ſervice, free grace in the promiſe of the reward) as exclud all merit.</p>

                  <p>And therefore how vain are their pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſayings for evaſions, <hi>That our merits are his gifts; That they merit through the merits of Chriſt,</hi> or that Chriſt has meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that we ſhould merit: and that good works are <hi>meritorious through divine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation:</hi> All which ſpeaks contradiction or folly. For to ſay Chriſt has merited that we ſhould merit, is to acknowledge we are indebted to God, for giving his Son to die for our ſins, and for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing or meriting the firſt grace for us; but then that we enabled thereby, ſhould begin to make God and our Saviour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to us, in the reward of eternal life. Chriſt indeed has merited that we ſhould not be bound to merit, that is, to obtain ſalvation by our merits, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of exact obedience by our ſelves, according to the Legal Covenant.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95326:74"/>Again, he has merited that we might be under <hi>grace,</hi> and ſo perform good works, <hi>created unto good works.</hi> To ſay that Chriſt has merited that we ſhould merit, or that God accepts our works as truly merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, is to alledge that for the merit of works, which excludes it: To obtain the reward by works, becauſe they are done in Grace, or of grace, is ſenſe; but to merit by works, becauſe done in or by grace is folly and contradiction.</p>

But we reply, this is to change the Caſe, which enquires <hi>de facto</hi> of the deed or being, to that which enquires <hi>de poſſibili,</hi> of the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The queſtion is, whether the words <hi>This is Wine,</hi> or <hi>this is my body:</hi> do of themſelves imply ſuch a change, there being nothing elſe evidently ſhewing us the change done or to be done? if they do, then is there no certainty in ſpeech, (as was ſhewen above) no not in Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive propoſitions, as theſe are, and ſhould be therefore moſt punctual and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their affirming or denying any thing.</p>
               <p>As for the poſſibility or power of changing one ſubſtance into another we doubt not of: but if that change be to be ſignified by the propoſition <hi>this is Wine,</hi> (the firſt ſubſtance <hi>Water,</hi> remaining

                  <hi>The Cup is called by our Saviour the New Teſtament, for that it was a holy ſigne of the New Teſtament,</hi> pa. 230. This is careleſly ſet down, but let us ſee what he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95326:95"/>ſaith to it; inſtead of giving a direct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he firſt challenges any Proteſtant to produce any clear text of Scripture, where that reaſon mentioned in the objection is alledged; but if he had fully ſet down the objection, the force of it (as we ſhall ſee preſently) would have extorted this to be the reaſon why it is called the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which muſt needs be a figurative ſpeech; and therefore implying it to be the ſigne, Sacrament, or ſeal of the New Teſtament; confirmed in his blood; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in ſtead of a direct anſwer, he gives us a needleſs diſcourſe of the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and then anſwers, <hi>I deny that by New Teſtament is underſtood a ſigne of the New Teſtament, but truly and really the New Teſtament it ſelf,</hi> 233. this is a careleſs miſtake, for <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in the objection is taken for that which is truly the New Teſtament it ſelf: nor does it imply, that by New Teſtament is underſtood the ſigne of the New Teſtament; but that the verb <hi>is</hi> which couples <hi>this</hi> and the <hi>new Teſtament</hi> together, is put for <hi>ſignificat, ſignifies,</hi> or is <hi>the ſigne.</hi> Thirdly, from <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.8. where the Teſtament of God with the Iſraelites was confirmed with blood, and the like ſaying uſed, <hi>This is the blood of the teſtament which the Lord hath made
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95326:95"/>with you,</hi> it muſt be real blood, not a ſigne or figure of it, which is here called the blood of the Teſtament, for ſuch a ſolemn Teſtament required no leſs, but rather more, then that in <hi>Exodus,</hi> to be confirmed with true blood, pa. 235, 236. This is true, but here's his failing, firſt that the true blood by which our Saviours Teſtament was confirmed, and to which that in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and all other ſprinklings of blood under the Law referred, was the blood ſhed on the Croſs, as the Apoſtle plainly ſhews in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebr.</hi> whereas this Author refers it to the blood in the Sacrament, which is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Teſtament, but by refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the blood on the Croſs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he gives us no direct ſenſe of the propoſition, <hi>this Cup is the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my blood:</hi> to exempt it from that figurative manner of ſpeech, which we contend our Saviour uſed throughout this Sacrament. He acknowledges it to be in the Canon of the Maſſe, and they ſay it dayly in ſaying the Maſſe: and could not but know, that the neceſſity of a figurative ſpeech to be admitted in that propoſition, was the intent and force of the former objection, yet gives us no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it; knowing that if a figure be admitted here, why <hi>not in this is my body?</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:95326:96"/>And if the words were <hi>operative</hi> there for turning the bread into his body, why not here for tranſubſtantiating the Cup or that which was in it, into the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

               <p>But he goes on, or rather urges again what he had ſaid. <hi>If our Saviour</hi> inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted each ſpecies or kinde apart, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſaving grace, then he which receives either kinde devoutly, receives that <hi>grace for which he inſtituted it,</hi> p. 329. But this is cunning through ambiguous expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For our Saviour inſtituted each <hi>apart,</hi> that is, <hi>ſeveral</hi> or one after the other, but not that one therefore ſhould be received without the other. Or if this <hi>apart,</hi> belongs to <hi>confer,</hi> it is true that our Saviour did inſtitute each to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer (and he that receives devoutly does in each receive) the grace for which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted that kind or part: but does not receive the whole grace for which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the Sacrament. Alſo he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the one kind or part, devoutly in order and with reſpect to the other, he receives the grace for which it was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted: but he cannot aſſure himſelf of receiving that grace who receives the one <hi>excluſively</hi> to the other; for how ſhall he be partaker of Chriſts bloodſhed in the Sacrament, or as it is repreſented, held out and exhibited in the Sacrament, that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:95326:117"/>will only receive that kinde or part, which gives him the body to eat, not that <hi>bloodſhed</hi> to drink it?</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> I have been the longer upon his firſt Aſſay; becauſe what is already ſaid will meet with moſt of his ſophiſtical Replyes. As when to the next objection <hi>p.</hi> 330. <hi>that the Prieſt is obliged to receive the Cup notwithſtanding, that according to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Tenet,</hi> he had received a true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <hi>in the Hoſt:</hi> He anſwers by their being Prieſts, and by the reaſon of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; upon which double account, he will have the Prieſt obliged to both, not Lay people. This appears vain by what was ſaid above Num. II. &amp; IIII.</p>
               <p>So to the following objection,
<note place="margin">A compleat refection intended in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> taken from the <hi>compleat Refection</hi> by meat and drink: He anſwers as he ſaid above, that both the graces of ſpiritual meat and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual drink, or <hi>grace ſufficient to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is conferred in each kinde: and <hi>All that can be gathered from this objection is only that our Saviour in the firſt Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gave a moſt plentifull and abundant banquet, whereof each part was ſufficient to confer life,</hi> p. 332, 333. Now albeit in a plentifull feaſt many diſhes might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; yet none can ſay it is either a plentiful or ſufficient feaſt and Refection: if drink be wholly denied. And conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95326:118"/>what our Saviour purpoſed by this Sacrament (which he made <hi>ſanguinis ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſi,</hi> of his blood ſhed, and that of his <hi>New Teſtament</hi>) it muſt needs be his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that both ſhould alwayes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: nor finally does one confer that ſaving grace (as was ſaid above) if the other be wilfully neglected. His pretence from <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.57. <hi>He that eateth me ſhall live by me,</hi> to prove the ſufficiency of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in one kinde, is inconſequent: for the verſes before, 53, 54, 56. ſhew one as needful as the other; As when it is ſaid, <hi>He that repents and believes</hi> ſhall be ſaved: both are ſet down as neceſſary: and we may not conclude, becauſe we meet ſometimes with one only mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as <hi>Jo.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 47. <hi>He that believeth hath everlaſting life:</hi> therefore this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other is ſufficient. Faith (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſaid) by the ſame act of believing, eats his fleſh and drinks his blood, <hi>extra Sacramentum,</hi> out of the Sacrament; but if we come to do this in the Sacrament (that is, by faith there to partake of his body and blood) the eating and drinking muſt be diſtinct acts, according to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental way of participation: for ſo his <hi>blood ſhed</hi> is not drunk in the eating of his fleſh.</p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:95326:118"/>
               <p>And therefore the people are deceived, while they are borne in hand, that <hi>by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in one kinde, they are not deprived of any grace neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> (as he <hi>p.</hi> 334.) For that Church as much as in it lies, does deprive them of the benefit of Chriſts blood ſhed in this Sacrament; and however it pleaſe God to deal in mercy with the poor abuſed people: yet no man can aſſure himſelf of receiving the grace of this Sacrament, that doth wilfully neglect and refuſe to receive it, as our Saviour inſtituted and appointed it. But ſee how he would ſtop the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples mouths in the cloſe of this point, by telling them, that albeit they <hi>want the extent of grace,</hi> which <hi>Prieſts have by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in both kinds, yet they have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: and that they are obliged to have reſpect, not only to their own ſpiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in the encreaſe of grace by this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> but alſo, <hi>to the reverence due unto it, and muſt be content to want that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, when it cannot be obtained but by ſome irreverence offered to this divine Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> p. 335. As if our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the participation of his blood ſhed, and <hi>bidding all to drink thereof,</hi> could not or did not foreſee, what incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience would or might happen upon the obſerving of what he appointed: and as
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95326:119"/>if the greateſt irreverence, were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience: and obedience to his will, the greateſt Reverence. But the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and honour of the Prieſt is hereby provided for among them, and the people muſt be content with a mutilate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> The next argument is from the Precept <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">All com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to drink of the Cup.</note> p. 341. where he pittifully ſhuffles, running backward and forward to evade the force of it.

                  <hi>Ye ought to waſh</hi>— the ſpeech is not imperative, but indicative, of a duty taught them by that action or example of our Saviours waſhing their feet, <hi>viz.</hi> the duty of <hi>humility:</hi> not binding them to that very action or expreſſion by waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as this precept of <hi>drinking</hi> doth, and needs muſt binde all who come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and when they come. Now that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. <hi>Take,</hi> though it doth not abſolutely command the <hi>Mode,</hi> or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of taking it in the hand (he aimed in this inſtance at the Prieſts putting it into their mouths) yet doth it peremptorily

               <p>Again, being loath to have it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: <hi>The words</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cannot import a command, but may ſignify only a bare invitation:</hi> as when <hi>we ſay to a Gueſt, ſit down, eat,</hi> and <hi>drink of this</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> p. 334. But he ſhould have conſidered, that if they may ſignify only a <hi>bare invitation,</hi> then the one as well as other, and both of them (the <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinkng</hi>) may be refuſed: and ſo the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament left free for every one to receive or not to receive it at all, which below he will deny. Again, though it be but manners among men, to leave a Gueſt at his liberty, and therefore ſuch words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a freedome left them, do not impoſe a neceſſity, or duty, as this ordaining of this Sacrament doth: where it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by <hi>drinking</hi> and <hi>eating,</hi> and doing ſo as at firſt was done, to remember and ſhew forth our Saviours death: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it is our great and neceſſary concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to receive the benefit there offered. And yet you uſe not the people ſo kindly as a man that makes a feaſt, doth his gueſt: for dare you thus invite the people, and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:95326:120"/>give them the freedom to <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink?</hi> does not the Prieſt notwithſtanding thoſe words of Invitation, eat and drink up all himſelf, in the celebration of the Maſs, the people looking on only? Nay is not this <hi>Invitation</hi> come to a plain <hi>Interdict,</hi> a forbidding of the people to receive the Cup? <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; ye ſhall <hi>not drink</hi> of this, ſaith the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I might adde, is not this a mocking of the people? nay is it not a mocking of Almighty God, when in a prayer of the Canon of the Maſs, it is ſaid by the Prieſt (according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient practiſe) <hi>quotquot ſumpſerimus</hi>— implying that others have received with the Prieſt and in both kinds, whereas none do nor are ſuffered to do.</p>
               <p>At length Mr. <hi>Spencer</hi> yeilds a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given in thoſe words, <hi>Drink ye all of this:</hi> but given <hi>to the Apoſtles only, and extendible to Biſhops and Prieſts:</hi> But why to them and no farther? here he ſeems to refer the meaning and Extent of ſuch Commands given without Limitation, to the practice and perpetual tradition of the Church, <hi>p.</hi> 344, 345. We deny not, but that is a good direction for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding matters of practice; and in this point we affirm, and are ſure the practice and perpetual Tradition of the Church
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95326:120"/>for above 12. hundred years is againſt this <hi>Romiſh</hi> innovation: And we are ſure, that Antiquity is againſt them, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Capacity</hi> of thoſe perſons to whom the Sacrament was firſt given, and who were then <hi>bidden all of them to drink;</hi> which muſt therefore be <hi>extendible not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> but to all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtians, who were then repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in thoſe firſt perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> Now as for the other Precept, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Do this, concerns allpreſent.</note> he will have a ſtrict command in thoſe words, ſo far as concerns the Prieſt, to <hi>bleſs, conſecrate, offer, adminiſter,</hi> 346. But its plain the Prieſt doth not as our Saviour did, for he does not <hi>adminiſter</hi> ſo oft as he <hi>conſecrates;</hi> and when he does <hi>adminiſter</hi> it is not in both kinds as our Saviour did: Again if the Prieſt be hereby bound to <hi>adminiſter,</hi> is not the people conſequently bound to <hi>receive?</hi> He is not willing to grant it yet, but ſhall below; here he makes inſtance in <hi>Prieſthood</hi> and <hi>marriage,</hi> which they are <hi>bound to adminiſter, when juſtly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do it, yet is no man bound to receive the one or the other,</hi> 347. It is ſtill the hap of his Inſtances to be impertinent: for he himſelf acknowledges a little below, the diſparity between receiving of prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood or Marrioge, and the receiving of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:95326:121"/>the Sacrament of the body and blood of our Saviour under both kinds; the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity I ſay between them as to this point of freedome: for firſt, though no man be bound to receive Prieſthood or Marriage, yet is neither the one or other ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, but when ſome are to receive them. Secondly, let theſe paſs for the preſent as Sacraments: yet is it very inconſequent, from the liberty in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe, which concern the particular eſtates of men, to argue for like freedom in receiving that Sacrament, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the ſalvation of all Chriſtians; or from the free choice of a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or ſtate, to conclude an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency in the duty of our general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or calling, as we are Chriſtians: the duties of which profeſſion, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on us in order to our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Again he replies;
<note place="margin">The obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that precept, upon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> That command may be anſwered by ſaying, <hi>It is a precept gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Church in general,</hi> that what <hi>our Saviour here commands be done,</hi> p. 346. We have heard of an <hi>implicit faith,</hi> but here is an <hi>implicit receiving;</hi> ſo it be done in the Church, the command is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; as if every Chriſtian in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, were not concerned in the purpoſe of this Sacrament, or could live by another
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:95326:121"/>mans eating and drinking. At length perſwaded by S. <hi>Thomas</hi> his authority, (he would not by S, <hi>Pauls</hi> alone) to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the <hi>do this,</hi> both to the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> and the Cup, and to admit a precept in it for the Laity, to receive this Sacrament: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to the uſual refuge; They ſatisfy the precept of eating and drinking if they receive it in either, <hi>p.</hi> 148, 149. that is, they drink the Cup, if they eat the Bread. His S. <hi>Thomas</hi> his Invention of concomitancy will not ſalve this, nor can the Reader be ſatisfied with the <hi>faſt</hi> and <hi>looſe,</hi> this Author ſo often playes in anſwering to the precept, <hi>Do this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The order</hi> he ſpeaks of, <hi>preſcribed by holy Church, now ordaining both to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, now but one:</hi> and <hi>to ſome the Hoſt to others the Calice only:</hi> doth no where appear, but in the late orders of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Church. In the ancient Church (though ſometimes in caſes of neceſſity, one part might be adminiſtred privately) never were ſuch <hi>Orders</hi> made: nor ſuch practice uſed publickly, ſolemnly, or when both could be adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood:</hi> he anſwers. It is <hi>a general command</hi> given to the generality of Chriſtians, to <hi>receive his body by way of eating, and his blood by
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:95326:122"/>way of drinking: and to every particular Chriſtian to concurr to the execution of this command:</hi> not <hi>that every one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is obliged to do both, but that ſome eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome drinking, others doing both, each particular confers to the performance of the Command,</hi> p. 351. Thus the body and blood ſhed, are with them received in either kind by virtue of their <hi>concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and the command of eating and drinking is ſatisfied and performed by vertue of <hi>Concurrence,</hi> every perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to the performance of it. This is Implicit receiving; ſo both be <hi>done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you</hi> it is ſufficient, when as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour layes both upon every <hi>particular</hi> perſon, and ſo repeats it in the <hi>ſingular,</hi> He that <hi>eateth</hi>— and <hi>drinketh,</hi> v. 54, 58. and that in order to <hi>his having life in him;</hi> His inſtancing in the precept <hi>to teach and baptize all Nations, Mat.</hi> 28. not bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>each of the Apoſtles in particular to teach and baptize the whole world,</hi> 352. has the fate of all his inſtances, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent; for it runs upon the <hi>extent</hi> of the object only, <hi>(the whole world)</hi> which implyed an impoſſibility, not upon the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of the whole duty or office, which did not admit a liberty of forbearing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act of preaching or baptizing. For
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:95326:122"/>as the obligation in the Sacrament is to eating and drinking, ſo there to a double act of their office, Teaching and Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, That Apoſtle that would ſet down with doing one of them only, ſhould not do his duty.</p>
               <p>It is objected <hi>p.</hi> 356. If it be given ſo to the Church in general, then may the command be ſatisfied and performed, ſo be it the Church provides certain perſons to receive, and exempt all the reſt. In his anſwers to this, we may ſee the giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mans brain, when ſet againſt the apparent Truth of Gods word: <hi>If we take the ſenſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>according to the common ſtrein of Doctors, every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar will be obliged by the words— (except ye eat and—) eſpecially ſecing that S.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor 11.</note> Paul <hi>extends this matter of Communion to each particular.</hi> This is one Truth he ſo much <hi>ſtreined</hi> againſt above, notwithſtanding thoſe Doctors, and S. <hi>Paul:</hi> that every particular man is obliged— but how! and to what? to <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi>— thats expreſs both in 6. of <hi>Joh.</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>but disjunctively</hi> (as he ſaith elſwhere, <hi>p.</hi> 350.) that is, to eat <hi>or</hi> drink: Heer's the giddineſs and vanity of wilfull error, — to make alimitation or gloſs clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the text, for our Saviours words
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95326:123"/>oblige to theſe acts <hi>conjunctively,</hi> eat— and drink— thrice in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> thrice conjunctively eat— and drink 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in anſwer to the former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, he grants <hi>it was not in the power of the Apoſtles to exempt any of the Twelve from concurring to the converſion of the Nations,</hi> p. 356. If he will have this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, he ſhould adde; but it was in their power to exempt ſome of the Twelve, from doing the whole duty, or ſeveral acts enjoyned by our Saviour: that if one of them <hi>taught</hi> only, another baptized onely, and ſo all partially concurred to the performing our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours command, it had been ſufficient: He will not ſurely ſay this: yet dare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it in their Churches, exempting the people from the one part of duty enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them by our Saviour: He ſubjoyns, <hi>It is not in the Churches power to exempt any one from this precept, by having it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of other Chriſtians appointed by her Anthority,</hi> 357. Yet their Church takes power to exempt from one part <hi>(drinking</hi> his blood-ſhed) which lyes under the command and obligation, as well as the other of <hi>eating.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:95326:123"/>
               <p>Thirdly, he grants here another Truth, to the acknowledgment of his Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency above: where he inſtanced in the freedom of receiving Prieſthood and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, to imply a liberty of receiving, or not receiving the Cup, but here he grants this <hi>Sacrament is not left free (as Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and Prieſthood are) without a divine Precept</hi> that every <hi>Chriſtian ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it,</hi> p. 357. This is fair, but ſee the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy ſtill and giddineſs of wilfull error: That eating only is ſufficient, becauſe our Saviour <hi>when he expreſſes himſelf in the ſingular number attributes eternal life to it; He that cateth me ſhall live by me, Joh.</hi> 6.57. Nay, that the words <hi>(ye eat—</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> v. 53.) <hi>cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a neceſſity of both kinds to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, without contradiction to this Text,</hi> ſo he, p. 358, 359. As if one ſhould reaſon, If it be true that <hi>he who is born of the spirit ſhall enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven,</hi> then cannot the Text <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>unleſs a man be born of water and ſpirit,</hi> include a neceſſity of both, —nor when the Scripture requires <hi>Repent and believe Mar.</hi> 1. that cannot include a neceſſity of both for the kingdome of heaven, without contradiction to the Text <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> where one only is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,

               <p>Again, it may be ſaid, that eating is ſometimes mentioned alone in that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as anſwerable to the occaſion of the diſcourſe, <hi>Manna</hi> and <hi>bread from heaven</hi> and as fit to ſet out the reception of faith, which at the ſame time alſo drinks his blood ſhed: ſo it did till the Sacrament was inſtituted, and ſo it ſtill doth, <hi>extra Sacramentum,</hi> out of the Sacrament, but if we apply this to the receiving of Chriſt in the Sacrament, then <hi>drinking</hi> is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, both to anſwer the whole act of Faith, and the whole purpoſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, in participating his blood ſhed and receiving a full Refection: And therefore though eating only be expreſſed in that v. 57. yet he could not but ſee that our Saviour when he <hi>ſpoke in the ſingular number,</hi> mentions and enjoyns them both, v. 34, 36.</p>
               <p>His inſtancing in the command about the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> enjoyning to <hi>kill, roſt, ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle</hi> and <hi>eat,</hi> but not binding every one to perform all, but ſome one thing, ſome another, <hi>p.</hi> 361. proves as all his former impertinent; for the concernment here is in the reception or partaking of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament (of the Paſſover by eating, of the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:95326:124"/>Euchariſt by eating and drinking:) and I hope, he will not deny but all and every one of the Iſraelites were bound to eat the Paſſover, and to eat it as the Lord enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, under pain of being <hi>cut off, Exod.</hi> 12. Indeed if we take in all the actions to be done in and about the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, thoſe that concern the <hi>conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>adminiſtration,</hi> as well as the <hi>reception</hi> of it: every one is not bound to perform all; but that which concerns the <hi>Reception,</hi> belongs to all; not to do all that our Saviour did, but all that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples then did, belongs to all to do; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they then repreſented the whole company of the faithful.</p>
               <p>He cloſes up this point and his whole diſcourſe with ſome paſſion againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants— charging them with <hi>an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and baſe eſteem of the moſt ſacred body and blood of our Saviour: not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that either of them</hi> (as they are in this Sacrament) <hi>is fit to confer ſaving grace to ſuch as devoutly receive them</hi>— p. 363.

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:95326:125"/>when in caſe of neceſſity the one is <hi>devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> received: but we queſtion how they that wilfully refuſe one of them (the blood ſhed) can be ſaid <hi>devoutly</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or can expect that ſufficient grace, which is given in the Sacrament to them, that receive it according to our Saviours Inſtitution. It is not any derogating from the worth of our Saviours body and blood, but a due regard to his Will and Command that cauſes us to ſtand upon receiving both: What he adds runs ſtill upon that Aſſertion <hi>(that there is not any expreſs command given in Scripture to all particular Chriſtians to receive both,</hi> pag. 365.) which we ſhewed above to be falſe— by our Saviours commands in his Inſtitution of this Sacrament; <hi>Drink ye all,</hi> and <hi>Do this;</hi> by <hi>what he ſeverely denounced</hi> Joh. 6.53. by what S. <hi>Paul</hi> delivers as received from our Saviour; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.

               <p>To conclude,
<note place="margin">Bel. de beat.

That which the Heathens obſerved in the practiſe or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſtians was, (as we have ſeen above) their allowing of and depending
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:95326:137"/>on the Miniſtery of Angels, their reſort to Martyrs Tombs, their offering up prayers there, their keeping the daies of the Martyrs ſufferings, their celebrating of the Martyrs praiſe; Now it was a groſs miſtake in the Heathens, thence to infer, the Chriſtian Church did worſhip them, or did ſet Angels and Martyrs in like place and office, as they did their <hi>Daemons</hi> and <hi>Heroes;</hi> So is it a falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Chriſtians then, to conclude a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Worſhip, and to make the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken allegation of the Heathen a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for it; when the Fathers in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering their objection, ſo plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the miſtake, and deny the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. There were ſome exceſſes, it is like, committed at the Tombs of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, by ſome inconſiderat Chriſtians, but not to be charged upon the Church: as appears by St. <hi>Aug.</hi> his anſwer above, to <hi>Maximus</hi> the Grammarian: <hi>A Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicis Chriſtianis— None of the Dead are worſhipped, by Catholick Chriſtians:</hi> what ever exceſſes were uſed by ſome,

<note place="margin">Places of Scripture alledged for Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which are the only Texts that have any ſemblance or pretence for Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Saints or Angels: they are miſtaken as applied to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>That Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8. where the four living Creatures, and the 24 Elders are ſet out as <hi>falling down before the Lamb, having harps and viols full of odours</hi> (or
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:95326:139"/>incenſe) <hi>which are the prayers of the Saints.</hi> Here the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> that would have theſe <hi>prayers of the Saints,</hi> to be meant of the prayers of men living, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by the Saints in heaven, are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: for the whole place is a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church below offering up prayers to God by Chriſt (the Lamb) and thoſe Euchariſtical or prayers of thankſgiving and praiſe chiefly, for the Victories of the Lamb, and Redemption by Chriſt, as the next verſe ſpecifies them. Thus <hi>Viega</hi> underſtands them of the Church below, and he follows good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in it.</p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.10. <hi>how long O Lord</hi>— Here alſo is a great miſtake of <hi>Romaniſts</hi> making this a formal prayer of the Martyrs for revenge: which ſtands not with that charity they have in ſo great a degree; and therefore this is but a figurative or emblematical repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Souls lying under the Altar and calling for revenge, only to ſhew the certainty of that judgement and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which God would in time bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heathen Perſecutors for their bloud: as when <hi>Abels bloud</hi> is ſaid to <hi>cry</hi> for vengeance. And for the Argument they make, <hi>If the Souls of Martyrs cry for Vengeance upon their Enemies, therefore
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:95326:140"/>their charity much more prompts them to pray for Gods ſervants:</hi> It fails firſt in the Antecedent; for they do not as we ſee make any formal prayer for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: and then it fails in the Inference, for it would only conclude that they do pray for the Church Militant, which we grant; not that they offer up prayers made to them, which is the point in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>The third Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. where <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angel is ſaid to ſtand by the Altar, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a golden Cenſer, and much incenſe was given to him, that he might offer it with the prayers of all Saints.</hi> A great miſtake this and impious to make this the office of any created Angel, for the very Text ſeems to imply that this was a ſpecial Angel differing from the ſeven Angels, ſet out in the ſecond verſe as miniſtring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and what one created Angel is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for this, to receive and offer up their prayers that are made by all the Saints or juſt men on Earth?

<note place="margin">Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. againſt Invocation.</note> becauſe the Defenders of Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation can bring no witneſs for it beyond the middle of the fourth Age: Our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond proof is from Teſtimonies exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or denying ſuch Invocation. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> in his firſt Book ſpeaks of Hereticks that had ſtrange Phanſies concerning <hi>Angels,</hi> attributing much unto them; in relation to which he denies,
<note n="†" place="margin">Iren. l. 2. c. 25. <hi>Nec invocationibus Angelicis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat aliquid, nec incantatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus, ſed purè &amp; mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſte orationes dirigens ad Dominum qui fecit omnia, &amp; nomen Domini Jeſu Chriſti invocans</hi>—</note> 
                  <hi>that the Church did do any thing</hi> (he ſpeaks of miraculous Cures done then) <hi>by Invocation of Angels, nor by incantations, but purely and manifeſtly directing prayers to the Lord that made all, and invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Fevardentius</hi> his Gloſs here will not help, ſaying the Father means <hi>Invocation of ſuch evil ſpirits as the former Hereticks uſed:</hi> for if the Church had uſed, to the working of thoſe cures, the Invocation of good Angels, the ſame Father could not have condemned their invocations, and ſo abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied (without any mention or limitation of ſuch uſe in the Church) all <hi>Angelical Invocations;</hi> could not have bound up
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:95326:145"/>the prayers of the Church (as we ſee here) to God the father through the Name of his Son. So afterward when Cures were ſo frequently don at the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Martyrs, the firſt and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar way was, as here, to direct their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God through Chriſt; not uſing <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations</hi> of the Martyr; which was the abuſe creeping in by degrees, as we ſhall ſee below.

               <p>And therefore what fals from them in this kinde, we ſhould rather cover or fairly interpret, then produce it as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> do in this point, to make argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>This may be inferred alſo from the words of that Council, when it tels us (as we had it
<note n="*" place="margin">Num. 2.</note> above) what Juſtification is: <hi>A tranſlation from the ſtate of the Sons of Adam, into the Adoption of the Sons of God through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Which though no good definition, yet implies there is in Juſtification a <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins and the condemnation due to them; under which all men lye while they are in the <hi>ſtate of the Sons of Adam.</hi> Again it implies, ſuch perſons acquitted of their ſins, are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into favour, as ſons by <hi>Adoption,</hi> and that gives <hi>Right</hi> in the ſame moment to the <hi>heavenly inheritance.</hi> Laſtly, that all this <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> which implies

               </p>
               <p>Now albeit <hi>Inherent Righteouſneſs</hi> be given,

We ſee other purpoſes of Inhaerent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs given us, then that we ſhould be Juſtified by it.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that the accepting of us as righteous in our Juſtification follows immediately and is intrinſecally joyned with Remiſſion of ſins, is plain by the

Alſo, that the Imputation of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould not be confined (as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> would have it or delight to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it) to the bare importance of <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:</hi> they might think it reaſonable by that which they yield to the ſatisfactions of Saints appliable and <hi>imputable</hi> to others; For when we urge (againſt that Treaſure of their Church, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of it) that common judgment of the School, <hi>Meritum non excedit Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> Merit exceeds not the Perſon, Chriſt only excepted: They diſtinguiſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the good works and ſufferings of the Saints, as <hi>Satisfactory,</hi> and as <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious:</hi> and ſay as they are Meritorious, they exceed not the Perſon, but as Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, they are imputable, appliable to others. Which albeit ſaid without ground
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:95326:178"/>or warrant, might keep them from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining thus the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs to the point of <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> and allow it to be not only as <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> in the Juſtification of a Sinner, but as <hi>Meritorious</hi> alſo, to all effects and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for compleating the act of Juſtification in the accepting of the Perſon as Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to whom it is imputed or applied.</p>

<note place="margin">Bel. ubi ſuprà, <hi>Quo. loco, ut exponunt</hi> Chryſ. Ambr. Theoph. <hi>Apoſtolus docet in baptiſino purgari homines &amp; Sanctificari: atque hoc ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum eſt juſtificari.</hi>

                  <hi>in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying he Sanctified them;</hi> if he had ſaid in ſanctifying he juſtifies, it had ſounded ſomething to the <hi>Cardinals</hi> purpoſe; but in ſaying <hi>juſtifieans ſanctificavit,</hi> he ſpeaks that (which we often inſinuated above) the <hi>concomitancy</hi> of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with, and the <hi>dependence</hi> of it upon Juſtification.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cardinals</hi> next Teſtimony, is from <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 7. where he would conclude <hi>Regeneration</hi> to be <hi>Juſtification.</hi> The place is anſwerable to that above, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. and may be accordingly anſwered, that there is <hi>regeneration</hi> and <hi>juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> mentioned, and that they go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but that Regeneration is Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſtill the falſe aſſertion of the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,</hi> inconſequently drawn from this, as from other places. He adds alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. which do prove, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſecond place, our being made like to Chriſt in ſanctification &amp; inhaerent righteouſneſs: but whats this to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by that Image or likeneſs? It was far from the Apoſtles intent to ſay any thing in thoſe places of Juſtification. Now whereas the <hi>Cardinal</hi> makes this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>as Chriſt was righteous, ſo ſhall we, but he was not righteous by imputation,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:95326:185"/>therefore not we</hi>— is fallacious, —It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes affirmatively not negatively: He was righteous by inhaerent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, therefore we ſhall be ſo; this is true. But he was not righteous by an imputed righteouſneſs, therefore not we; this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not: for we are to be made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous not in the ſame manner every way, and reciprocally, but ſo as we are capable of, and ſtand in need of being made righteous. But thus much may ſerve for the <hi>Cardinals</hi> Teſtimonies from Scripture which we have found either to be impertinently applyed, or to ſpeak againſt him: and therefore no marvel, that he could not alledge any Fathers ſo interpreting them, as he miſapplies them to Juſtification by inhaerent grace or righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> Now let us take a brief View of the Teſtimonies of Fathers which he brings as Witneſſes for him;
<note place="margin">Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Grace not proved by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> of which we may ſay: as we found in his allegations out of Scripture, that they prove there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerent Grace or righteouſneſs in us, not that we are <hi>properly juſtified</hi> by it; Amongſt all the Fathers
<note n="*" place="margin">Bel. l. 2. de Juſtif. cap. 8.</note> he cites, there appears but one <hi>Greek,</hi> and among his <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> chiefly, a good witneſs indeed, if taken as he means, To the many places alledged out
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:95326:185"/>of him, we may give this general anſwer; they either, only prove there is inhaerent righteouſneſs, or if they ſpeak of <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> by it, then is that word uſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Latine</hi> Etymology: of making a man juſt or righteous by a real inhaerent qualification: and that St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</hi> is ſo much inclined to interpret the word <hi>Grace</hi> uſed in Scripture, of the gift of grace inhaerent in us: and ſometimes to ſay a man is juſtified (<hi>i. e.</hi> made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inherently by it) came to paſs, by reaſon he had ſo much to do againſt the Pelagians in aſſerting that <hi>grace</hi> given and inherent in us: for they denied not the <hi>grace</hi> of God in the prime ſenſe, as it ſpeaks the <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>love</hi> of God to Mankinde: but made little or nothing of the other.</p>
               <p>The chief and moſt conſiderable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences cited by the <hi>Cardinal</hi> out of that Father are theſe.
<note place="margin">Aug. Confeſſ. l. 12. c. 15. <hi>Quantum diſtat inter lumen quod illuminat, &amp; quod il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminatur, tantùm diſtat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter juſtitiam juſtificantem, &amp; juſtitiam, quae ex justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatione facta eſt.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>As great a difference as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the light which doth il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate, and the light which is illuminated, ſo great a difference is there, between that righteouſneſs which does juſtifie</hi> (which ſurely is the Divine righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs) and that <hi>which ariſeth from Juſtification;</hi> which is the inhaerent; for
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:95326:186"/>elſe to take it as the <hi>Cardinal</hi> muſt for a compariſon between the <hi>inhaerent</hi> and <hi>actual</hi> righteouſneſs, there is not ſuch a difference between them. So this place proves there is inhaerent grace or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as <hi>light</hi> communicated unto us, doth not prove a juſtification by it, but by the righteouſneſs from whence that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerent righteouſneſs proceeds: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeaks againſt the <hi>Cardinal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another place alledged is this: <hi>Which Nature,

                     </note> when it is juſtified of the maker, is tranſlated from a deformed form to a beautiful form.</hi> Here the <hi>Cardinal</hi> thought ſo much noyſe of the word <hi>Form,</hi> would be enough to ſpeak the inhaerent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse to be the <hi>Form</hi> of juſtification; whereas this only proves our renewing, transforming from the Image of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> that is, that there is a new righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs alſo put in us, in our Juſtification, which we every where acknowledge; and is that which <hi>Theoph.</hi> ſaid above, <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficans Sanctificat,</hi> when he <hi>Juſtifies</hi> he <hi>Sanctifies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two other places he brings to prove the <hi>inhaerent</hi> to be our true righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: which we grant, in its <hi>order</hi> and <hi>meaſure,</hi> but not to the excluding of the

               <p>I need not trouble the Reader here with the Particular ſentences of the Fathers, uſing that expreſſion of <hi>Sola Fides,</hi> Faith only: The <hi>Cardinal</hi> has recited many,
<note place="margin">Bell. de Juſtificat. l. 1. c. 25.</note> and undertakes to anſwer them. Well, he acknowledges the Teſtimonies, and for his Anſwers they come to this, That <hi>Faith only,</hi> is ſet againſt the works of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Law.</hi> It is true, that it is ſometimes ſo: but we muſt not think that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle or Fathers denying Juſtification to be ſought or had by the works of the Law, do therefore admit our works under Grace to ſerve in the ſtead of the other for our Juſtification; but do rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that no men, <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian</hi> can be juſtified by doing, what they are bound to do by the Law or Commandement, under which they are, as
<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. IV. p. 102, 103.</note> above was ſhewen more amply.</p>
               <p>Another of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> Anſwers is; That <hi>faith only,</hi> excludes <hi>the outward work only</hi> (as in the ſentences there ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Chryſ.) but not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Charity.</hi> How it does not exclude Repentance and Charity we ſaid hard above; <hi>i. e.</hi> it admits them as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Remiſſion, but not to that condition or Cauſality rather, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> advances <hi>Charity</hi> to, in the work of our Juſtification: which is
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:95326:192"/>not a little to the prejudice of <hi>the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteouſneſs,</hi> and of that ſingular act of Faith, for which its ſaid, we are <hi>Iuſtified by faith only:</hi> But when the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> tels us, thoſe Fathers ſaid by <hi>faith only,</hi> becauſe the <hi>outward work</hi> was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: not to exclude <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Charity:</hi> he ſhould have told us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he meant charity in <hi>habit</hi> only, or as ſending forth its elicit Acts, and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly working— I ſuppoſe he will think it as great an abſurdity to attribute Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a <hi>bare, not working</hi> Habit, as to a bare and not working faith: which they falſly reproach us with; and then he ſhould have remembred, he made <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual</hi> inherent Righteouſneſs the <hi>Formal Cauſs</hi> of Juſtification, excluding the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,</hi> that is, charity as it is acting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly or outwardly; for this it muſt come to.</p>
               <p>A third ſort of Anſwer the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and generally they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have, for Teſtimonies of Fathers which by <hi>Faith only</hi> exclude all righteouſneſs in our ſelves (and cannot be ſhuffled off by ſaying, they exclude thereby all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Works before Grace, or done by power of our Free-wil without Grace) then to ſay, all <hi>righteouſneſs in us</hi> is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſometime denied, <hi>as of our ſelves,</hi>

And this we are taught to ſay, both by Fathers and Scripture, that ſo we may attribute the

But this is ſtill inconſequent as to the inferring of <hi>Works meritorious:</hi> unleſs they can ſay, God renders the reward to good works, according to <hi>Commutative</hi> juſtice, which gives one for one by equal proportion; but ſuch Juſtice is not found between God and Man; for man returns nothing to God, which he can call his own, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what he has received of God. As for the <hi>deſtributive</hi> or remunerative juſtice, it is true that God may be ſaid in ſome ſenſe to render the reward in
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:95326:200"/>juſtice; yet not for the <hi>merit</hi> of the works, but out of the <hi>bounty</hi> of his libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the faithfulneſs of his promiſe: God was not bound in juſtice to prepare, appoint, or promiſe ſuch a reward to ſuch works, but having appointed &amp; promiſed it, it is <hi>juſt</hi> with him to render according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of a ſinner (which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves ſay cannot be merited) uſeth the ſame word: <hi>that he might be juſt, i. e.</hi> in keeping his promiſe to all that <hi>believe in Jeſus.</hi> So when the Fathers in their high language ſpeak of Man making God his <hi>Debtor,</hi> they mean it only in regard of his own promiſe, whereby he has freely bound himſelf.

               <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi> is bold to affirm,
<note place="margin">Bel. li. 1. de Purgat. c. 15.</note> that Purgatory is an Article of the Catholick faith, and may be proved all the four
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:95326:215"/>waies, that points of Faith uſe to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by, <hi>viz.</hi> by expreſs Teſtimony of Scripture, with the Declaration of the Church; So is the <hi>Conſubſtantiality</hi> of the Son with the Father proved; or by evident deduction from that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in Scripture; So is the Article of <hi>two Wills</hi> in Chriſt proved, &amp;c. and ſo is Purgatory proved, ſaith the <hi>Cardinal:</hi> and he boaſts that he has ſo proved it, by giving us many places of Scripture miſtaken, as to that ſenſe, and many ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Fathers miſapplied, as to that purpoſe; which will appear upon the Trial following.</p>
               <p>It will appear, that this Doctrine of Purgatory is not Catholick, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of later Times: taking <hi>Riſe</hi> from that which St. <hi>Aug.</hi> hinted, as probable, touching pains after death: and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an <hi>Advancement</hi> by fabulous reports of Viſions and deluding apparitions in St. <hi>Gregories</hi> time and after; at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a <hi>Definition</hi> and eſtabliſhment in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing of it, They force many places of Scripture, and whatever they finde in the Fathers, concerning <hi>prayer for the Dead,</hi> or touching a <hi>purging Fire;</hi> though ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to other purpoſe: doing therein as thoſe Hereticks of whom St. <hi>Hilary</hi> ſaid

               <p>Again; he that well conſiders the place, will eaſily diſtinguiſh between the Fact of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the miſtaken collection or miſapplication of the writer of that Book. <hi>Judas</hi> no doubt did piouſly: for he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Sin or Sacriledge, as the cauſe why they were ſlain: verſ. 40. fell to his devotions; prayed and ſent a ſin-offering to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> v. 42.43. Not for the ſin of them that died: that's the miſtake of this Writer; but upon occaſion of their ſin, to divert the Wrath from the reſt of his Army: as <hi>Joſhua</hi> thought himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, upon the ſin of <hi>Achan, Joſh.</hi> 7.10. Alſo it is apparent that they died in their ſin (the things they had ſtoln being found
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:95326:222"/>about them) which argues both the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancy</hi> of this writer (who verſ. 45. ſuppoſes they died godly) and the <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency</hi> of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who ſuppoſe them in Purgatory, whither they ſend none that dye in their ſins, but only juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſons.</p>
               <p>They alſo urge 2 Tim. 1.18. for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Dead: whereas that prayer for <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> (ſuppoſing him dead at that time) has but reference to the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> which ſhall be imparted at the laſt day; to which alſo the prayers of the Ancient Church do much refer, and make nothing for Purgatory. And therefore all the Teſtimonies they bring out of the Ancient Fathers or Councils for praying for the Dead are impertinent as to the proving of a Purgatory: there being other Reaſons for ſuch praying; as we ſhall ſee. A wilful perverting it is of that Ancient Practice, to draw it off (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has done) from the firſt intent and purpoſe, to faſten it upon their conceit of Purgatory pains. We ſhall ſee this better by the trial follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> The Ancients, when they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelve to give reaſons of the Churches praying for the Dead,

Now if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſhould mean, that prayer did in part cut off ſuch mens ſins, then muſt he ſpeak according to that <hi>merciful opinion,</hi> of mitigating the pains of the Damned by the prayers of the Living; with which conceit ſome of the Ancients were tainted: as we ſhall ſee below; but this would be nothing to <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if his meaning had been, (as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> would have it) that prayer for the Dead did not cut off ſuch mens ſins: but that there was another ſort of ſinners, whoſe ſins and puniſhment it does in part cut off, (<hi>viz</hi> ſuch as have not fully ſatisfied here, but muſt do it elſewhere) then would <hi>Epiphanius</hi> (had he known ſuch Doctrine) have much forgotten himſelf, and betrayed the Church in not ſtopping the mouth of the Adverſary therewith. To conclude; <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his anſwer to <hi>Aerius</hi> muſt come to this: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Prayer for the Dead doth not (as you miſconceive the intent of it) cut off ſuch mens ſins, yet is it for other reaſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; for ſuch as were above recited.</p>
               <p>Another thing they object out of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> his words: that he ſaith, <hi>we pray

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:95326:227"/>then the remembering of them in their prayers there and then offered up. But more to this purpoſe in the next point.</p>
               <p>Again; The Prayers of the Church for the Dead muſt in all reaſon refer to ſuch a ſtate of the Dead as was then known and taught: which as we ſaw above, was inconſiſtent with Purgatory.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It was held by many, that the ſouls of the faithful were kept in a ſecret Receptacle till the Reſurrection: and it is probable that this opinion being ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, gave the firſt beginning to theſe prayers for the Dead, the moſt ancient forms of which begin with a <hi>Memento Domine,</hi> Remember them Lord, becauſe they held ſuch ſouls not yet admitted to Gods preſence: and did beg, that God would give them <hi>Refreſhment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Refrigeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> becauſe of that burning deſire they have to the time of their Reſurrection: and <hi>Light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lucem.</note> becauſe they had not yet the heavenly light of the beatifical Viſion: This is that <hi>ſtay</hi> or <hi>expectation of the reſurrection,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, It was held by moſt (as above alſo was ſhewen) that the Souls of Juſt and godly perſons, dying in Chriſt, went to bliſs &amp; heavenly happineſs: who at the laſt day ſhould riſe firſt, and receive their publick and final acquittance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation.
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:95326:228"/>And certainly the Ancient Church, in her prayers for the Dead, had ſpecial relation to the Day of Judgement and Reſurrection, finding how much it is referred to in Scripture. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12.18. and <hi>cap.</hi> 4.8. and elſewhere.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> Laſtly it was a private opinion, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and held by many:

That there is a forgiveneſs of ſins after death cannot be denied, ſo long as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is a <hi>Judgment of God</hi> to come; for when that comes, and paſſes upon the Souls of men, either privately at their death, or openly at the Laſt day, there is an <hi>abſolution</hi> of ſome, and a <hi>condemnation</hi> of others: a <hi>forgiving,</hi> and a <hi>not forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> in the world to come: whether we begin that Time at the day of Death, or of Reſurrection; but this forgiveneſs is nothing to Purgatory.</p>
               <p>Again, This forgiveneſs or not forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins in the world to come may have regard to the forgiveneſs or retaining of ſins by Man in the Miniſtry of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this life; ſo there is a looſing and binding on Earth, and a looſing and bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Heaven: in like manner a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſins forgiven in the Church in this life, and a declaration of ſins forgiven or not forgiven in the world to come
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:95326:236"/>For then it ſhall appear, that many ſins forgiven by Man, (<hi>Clave errante,</hi> through miſapplication of the <hi>Keyes</hi>) are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given of God, but ſhall receive ſentence of condemnation; and many that have been unjuſtly excommunicated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned here, ſhall be owned and abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there.

               <p>The Sins which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will have forgiven in the next life,

It is true, that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:95326:236"/>perſons after their Juſtification, are ſubject to the daily ſubreption of ſuch lighter ſins: but ſeeing, as St. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaith often, we do for them daily confeſs and ſay, <hi>Forgive us our debts</hi>— why ſhould not the general repentance and confeſſion with which ſuch Perſons dye, be available to the forgiveneſs of all ſuch failings and ſecret ſins, (that cannot be remembred in particular) through the merit of Chriſts perfect obedience, apprehended by the faith of ſuch juſtified perſons?</p>

<note place="margin">The ſtain or remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of Sin.</note> yet remaining after forgiveneſs of the guilt and puniſhment: (the doing away of which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> call forgiveneſs) what need is there of a Fire to purge them away? for it is not fire but the grace of God, likened unto fire, that can work that effect upon the ſoul. And why may not <hi>final grace,</hi> as ſome call it, do away the remaining corruption, at the parting of ſoul and body?

                  <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> For there he ſaith. <hi>The Bread</hi> (after conſecration) <hi>is not now common bread, but an Euchariſt,

And this is according to the <hi>Cardinals</hi> own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, who intending by this place to prove a <hi>Real preſence of Chriſts body and bloud</hi> in the Sacrament, argueth thus.

                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith, <hi>It conſiſts of the Earthly and the Heavenly part,</hi> but nothing can conſiſt, ſaith the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> of that which is not in it: not obſerving that it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves the ſubſtantial preſence of the Bread, for it <hi>conſiſts</hi> of the terrene as of the coeleſtial. Now we can ſay the coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial part, the ſubſtance of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud is given in the Sacrament; they dare not ſay it of the ſubſtance of the Terrene part; but betake them to the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of bread and wine: when as <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> ſpeaks of the ſubſtantial creatures and fruits of the earth, and it concerned him to mean ſo; elſe thoſe Hereticks might have ſaid our Saviour took thoſe Creatures to deſtroy them, and leaves only the appearance and ſpecies of thoſe
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:95326:250"/>things, which the God of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament had made.</p>
               <p>Again, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> makes another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from thoſe words of <hi>Irenaeus, Our bodies receiving the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,
<note place="margin">—<hi>jam non ſunt corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia, ſpem reſurrectionis ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentia.</hi> Iren. ibid.</note> are not now corruptible, as having the hope of a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:</hi> wherein he abuſes that good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and himſelf.

<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Our bodies ſhall be truly &amp; indeed incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, therefore the terrene bread is truly indeed made the body of Chriſt.</hi> Whereas that Father ſpeaks of the preſent, <hi>Our bodies are not now corruptible,</hi> which the <hi>Cardinal</hi> turns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>ſhall be incorruptible:</hi> becauſe he could not ſay, <hi>they are now truly and indeed incorruptible.</hi> So that according to this Father the Argument would ſtand thus: <hi>As our bodies now are incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> (not becauſe they are ſo according to nature and ſubſtance, but) in as much as they <hi>have the hope of a reſurrection;</hi> ſo the Bread is the body of Chriſt, (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe changed in nature and ſubſtance, but) in as much as by the grace of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration it is the communion of his body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> had to do with <hi>Marcion</hi> and ſuch Hereticks that denied Chriſt had a true and ſolid body. And he proves the

               <p>St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> or the Author of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>de Coena:</hi> of the Lords Supper ſaith, <hi>Even as in the Perſon of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Sicut in perſona Chriſti Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitas apparebat, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat Divinitas; ità ſacro vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibili divina ſe ineffabiliter infundit eſſentia.</note> the humanity appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the Divinity laid hid: So doth the divine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ineffably inſinuate it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the viſible ſacred Element.</hi> This place is cited for a Real Preſence, by the <hi>Cardinal:</hi> but he ſhould have conſidered, it cannot be ſuch a Real Preſence as will ſerve his turn. For the ſubſtantial preſence of the viſible outward element is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved by this ſaying of the Father; and a dangerous thing it is to make the bread and wine remain, as the <hi>Cardinal</hi> doth, in ſhew and appearance only; which renders this inſtance of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament held altogether uſeleſs againſt thoſe Hereticks, which held our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours body or humanity was but ſuch in appearance only, not ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Thus the Fathers that dealt with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks were bound to ſpeak properly and diſtinctly; and did ſo, as we have ſeen. We will add to theſe, Firſt, <hi>Origen</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by way of diſtinction,

               <p>Secondly, St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his ſaying is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, ſpeaking of the Elements: <hi>That they be what they were,

                  <hi>How much more operative is that word</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that they be what they were, and yet changed into another thing?</hi> The <hi>Cardinal</hi> therefore in his ſecond an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, retires to his old ſhift, ſaying that the outward <hi>Accidents</hi> remain what they were.

<pb n="484" facs="tcp:95326:254"/>mean the ſubſtantial being of ſuch bodies.

               </p>
               <p>I might add many Teſtimonies out of St. <hi>Aug.</hi> which upon the conſideration of the nature of a Sacrament, and upon other Reaſons and occaſions, ſpeak pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to the ſame purpoſe; that the viſible ſigns or outward Elements remain in their former ſubſtance, and yet are the body and bloud of Chriſt, ſo far as the reaſon and purpoſe of that Sacrament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.

               </head>
               <p>IN the ſtate of this Controverſie, we find two points aſſerted by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> (as appears by what ſaid above, <hi>Ch.</hi> VIII.)</p>
               <p n="1">I. That it may be ſo adminiſtred to the People, when it may be done otherwiſe: or that the People may be forbidden to receive it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That ſuch a receiving is a compleat Communion.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures that concern this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie were examined above. And for the Doctrine and Practiſe of the Catholick Church, we will only add ſome Generals, which will clear the point on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſide.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The confeſſion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> writers, granting the uſe of receiving in both kindes, continued from our Saviours time many ages throughout the Church. As may be ſeen in the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> in <hi>Alphonſ. de Caſtro, Soto, Coſterius, Tolet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. In anſwering to the Teſtimonies of the Fathers (aſſerting Communion in both
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:95326:255"/>kindes) we finde the <hi>Cardinal</hi> (and ſo the reſt of them) forced to acknowledge <hi>the uſe and practiſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bel. de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char. l. 4. c. 26.</note> and content to ſay, Thoſe Teſtimonies do not ſpeak <hi>a Neceſſity</hi> it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p>Now that it ſhould be ſo, where it can be ſo, <hi>neceſſarily</hi> follows upon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours <hi>precept, Drink ye all of this,</hi> (the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that did all drink, repreſenting then the whole company of the faithful, as the Fathers frequently aſſert) and upon the force of his <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and <hi>Example,</hi> and the anſwerable <hi>practice</hi> of the Catholick Church in the ſucceeding Ages; For if ſo, what Church or Age following ſhal think it ſelf at liberty to do otherwiſe?</p>
               <p n="3">III. In proving thoſe falſe Aſſertions, but neceſſary for the Romaniſts to hold, <hi>(viz.
<note n="*" place="margin">Bel. de Euchar. l. 4. c. 22. &amp; 33.</note> That the whole Reaſon of the Sacrament is contained in one kinde:</hi> and <hi>That there is not greater profit received by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in both kindes, then in one:)</hi> we finde the <hi>Cardinal</hi> cannot alledge One Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor riſe higher then <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. As they cannot bring one <hi>Sentence</hi> of any Ancient Father commending or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their <hi>half Communion:</hi> ſo the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> they give us for it, are impertinent, and unconcluding: far from proving, the People may <hi>be held from</hi> receiving in both:
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:95326:255"/>or made to believe they have a <hi>compleat Communion</hi> in One.</p>
               <p>A Collection of ſuch Inſtances we finde in the

                  <hi>Cardinal;</hi> The chief of them are theſe following. I. The <hi>breaking of Bread,</hi> often mentioned in the Acts of the Apoſtles, and ſometimes ſignifying the Sacrament. What then? They gave it to the people in one kinde only, becauſe one only is mentioned. If this be a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument as to the <hi>adminiſtration,</hi> it will be good alſo as to the <hi>Conſecration:</hi> they conſecrated it in one kinde only, becauſe one only is mentioned. But if the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> count it Sacriledge (as indeed it is) ſo to conſecrate: they might think it Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge alſo, wilfully ſo to adminiſter it.

From this uſage to conclude a liberty of abſtinence from the Wine in celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament is unreaſonable: 4. The Prieſt did that day receive but one kinde: therefore it might be likewiſe concluded: that it was (or may be) the practiſe of the Church, to have the Prieſt, as well as the people, confined to receive in one kinde.
